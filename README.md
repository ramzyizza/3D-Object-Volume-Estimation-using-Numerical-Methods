# 3D-Object-Volume-Estimation-using-Numerical-Methods
This project focuses on estimating object volume using Python without using any external libraries. It combines edge detection with central difference, smooth edge representation through interpolation, and volume calculation leveraging Simpson 1⁄3 Integration and Voxel Grid methods.
